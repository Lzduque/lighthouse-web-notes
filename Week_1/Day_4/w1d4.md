## JavaScript Functions as Objects

- functions can be stored in variables and passed around
- functions can do everything that other objects can do (like having attributes assigned to them).
Check this out:

```javascript

var myFn = function() {
  console.log("I am function.");
}

myFn.someAttribute = 42;
console.log(myFn.someAttribute);

function runner(f) {
  f();
}

runner(myFn);

```

## Data Structure

If you see an array you know you can loop trhough it, you can use index...
If you see an object you know you can acess its properties

consistency in Data Structures --> is good because it is reliable.

Create an object --> new --> in this case a particular object - a DATE

```javascript

tweeps[0].when = new Date('2018-11-28');
console.log(tweeps[0].when);
console.log(tweeps[0].when.toString()); // acessing the property of the object when inside the the object in position 0 inside the array!

tweeps[0]['where'] = 'Toronto' //assinging a new propertiy in the object in the index 0 of the array!

function timestamp(tweep) { //creating a new property in a object --> tweep is a reference for the object inside the function and thats why you should call this function with the index to say in wich object inside the array it willa ct!
  tweep.timestamp = new Date(); //if you dont specify a data, it will use the NOW.
}

timestamp(tweeps[0]); // you can call the function anywhere in the file, because a function is global, and the obect is a reference.
timestamp(tweeps[1]);


// if we do this:

timestamp(tweeps[0]); // that wont work, because the function was not declared by the time the function was called! It wont understand timestamp as a function! it will understand it as a variable, because at this point it did not go into the variable to discover it is a function!

var timestamp = function(tweep) { // NOW you have a variable!
  tweep.timestamp = new Date(); // the new here says - 'create an object'!
}

timestamp(tweeps[1]);  // that is going to work just fine, because the computer already entered the variable and discovered it is a function!
//varaibles are read only when the pc reaches the actual point of the file it is in. The function is "roughly" read before - it understands the function exists and if it needs to use it, it will go there and go trhough it!

// THAT IS WHY A FUNCTION IS A FIRST CLASS OBJECT!!
// Functions in javascript are first class objects. This means that javascript functions are just a special type of object that can do all the things that regular objects can do.

var approval = function (tweep) {
  tweep.approved = true;
}

approval(tweeps[3]);

//NOW YOU CAN WRITE A FUNCTION THAT DOES BOTH FUCNTIONS... OR ADD ANYTHING YOU WANT TO THE OBJECT YOU WANT!

function changeTweep(tweep, key, value) {
  // tweep.key = value; // that is wrong because when you use '.key' the pc will understand that you want literally a new property with the 'key' name!
  // tweep.['key'] = value; // that is wrong, too! because when you use '['key']' the pc will understand that you want literally a new property with the 'key' name, too!
  tweep[key] = value;
}

changeTweep(tweep[2], 'approved', true); // 'approved' will be literally the name of the key, true is a boolean value, it doe not need a ''. Keys are always converted to String by coersion.

for (i = 0 ; i<tweeps.length; i ++) {
  changeTweep (tweeps[i], 'Id', i)
}

// next step is to be able to change more things inside the function! now uyou can assign new keys and put values inside it. BUT what if the key already exists!

// function changeTweep (tweep, soSomething) {
//   doSomething(tweep);
// }

changeTweep(tweeps[2], timestamp); // timestamp is a variable, so it will call that variable, that is actually a function!


// but the function can be better! even better!

function changeTweep (handle, soSomething) {
  for (tweep of tweeps) {
    if (tweep.who == handle) {
      doSomething(tweep)
    }
  }
}

changeTweep('@mozilla', timestamp); // now you need to call it by the handle!!

// a function that its been passed to a function as a parameter is a callback! because it may be called when you inside another function! --> timestep is the callback!

changeTweep('@mozilla', function (tweep) {
  tweep.anything = "is Possible";
}); // now you have a fucntion that only exists if the function it is inside is called! Its a callback!

```
A callback function:

Is a function passed (by reference) into another function (let's call that one the "receiver" function)
The receiver function is therefore accepting behavior to perform by calling the callback function that it now has access to
The receiver function can decide to call the callback function at any time as many times as it wants
