ABOVE ARE THE CHAPTERS 1 TO 7 OF THE FILE, IF YOU WANT TO READ THE HOLE FILE GO TO THE WEB-SITE LISTED ABOVE!

## Table of Contents

  1. [Types](#types)
  1. [References](#references)
  1. [Objects](#objects)
  1. [Arrays](#arrays)
  1. [Destructuring](#destructuring)
  1. [Strings](#strings)
  1. [Functions](#functions)


## Types

  <a name="types--primitives"></a><a name="1.1"></a>
  - [1.1](#types--primitives) **Primitives**: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.

    - `string`
    - `number`
    - `boolean`
    - `null`
    - `undefined`
    - `symbol`

    ```javascript
    const foo = 1;
    let bar = foo;

    bar = 9;

    console.log(foo, bar); // => 1, 9
    ```

    - Symbols cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don’t support them natively.

  <a name="types--complex"></a><a name="1.2"></a>
  - [1.2](#types--complex)  **Complex**: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.

    - `object`
    - `array`
    - `function`

    ```javascript
    const foo = [1, 2];
    const bar = foo;

    bar[0] = 9;

    console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## References

  <a name="references--prefer-const"></a><a name="2.1"></a>
  - [2.1](#references--prefer-const) Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. eslint: [`prefer-const`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const.html), [`no-const-assign`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-const-assign.html)

    > Why? This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;

    // good
    const a = 1;
    const b = 2;
    ```

  <a name="references--disallow-var"></a><a name="2.2"></a>
  - [2.2](#references--disallow-var) If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. eslint: [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var.html)

    > Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    var count = 1;
    if (true) {
      count += 1;
    }

    // good, use the let.
    let count = 1;
    if (true) {
      count += 1;
    }
    ```

  <a name="references--block-scope"></a><a name="2.3"></a>
  - [2.3](#references--block-scope) Note that both `let` and `const` are block-scoped.

    ```javascript
    // const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.
    {
      let a = 1;
      const b = 1;
    }
    console.log(a); // ReferenceError
    console.log(b); // ReferenceError
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Objects

  <a name="objects--no-new"></a><a name="3.1"></a>
  - [3.1](#objects--no-new) Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-object.html)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const item = new Object();

    // good
    const item = {};
    ```

  <a name="es6-computed-properties"></a><a name="3.4"></a>
  - [3.2](#es6-computed-properties) Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.

    > Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.

    ```javascript

    function getKey(k) {
      return `a key named ${k}`;
    }

    // bad
    const obj = {
      id: 5,
      name: 'San Francisco',
    };
    obj[getKey('enabled')] = true;

    // good
    const obj = {
      id: 5,
      name: 'San Francisco',
      [getKey('enabled')]: true,
    };
    ```

  <a name="es6-object-shorthand"></a><a name="3.5"></a>
  - [3.3](#es6-object-shorthand) Use object method shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand.html)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue: function (value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };

    // good
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue(value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };
    ```

  <a name="es6-object-concise"></a><a name="3.6"></a>
  - [3.4](#es6-object-concise) Use property value shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand.html)

    > Why? It is shorter and descriptive.

    ```javascript
    const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';

    // bad
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,
    };

    // good
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker,
    };
    ```

  <a name="objects--grouped-shorthand"></a><a name="3.7"></a>
  - [3.5](#objects--grouped-shorthand) Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.

    > Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.

    ```javascript
    const anakinSkywalker = 'Anakin Skywalker';
    const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';

    // bad
    const obj = {
      episodeOne: 1,
      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
      lukeSkywalker,
      episodeThree: 3,
      mayTheFourth: 4,
      anakinSkywalker,
    };

    // good
    const obj = {
      lukeSkywalker,
      anakinSkywalker,
      episodeOne: 1,
      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,
      episodeThree: 3,
      mayTheFourth: 4,
    };
    ```

  <a name="objects--quoted-props"></a><a name="3.8"></a>
  - [3.6](#objects--quoted-props) Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quote-props.html)

    > Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const bad = {
      'foo': 3,
      'bar': 4,
      'data-blah': 5,
    };

    // good
    const good = {
      foo: 3,
      bar: 4,
      'data-blah': 5,
    };
    ```

  <a name="objects--prototype-builtins"></a>
  - [3.7](#objects--prototype-builtins) Do not call `Object.prototype` methods directly, such as `hasOwnProperty`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and `isPrototypeOf`. eslint: [`no-prototype-builtins`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-prototype-builtins)

    > Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider `{ hasOwnProperty: false }` - or, the object may be a null object (`Object.create(null)`).

    ```javascript
    // bad
    console.log(object.hasOwnProperty(key));

    // good
    console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key));

    // best
    const has = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty; // cache the lookup once, in module scope.
    /* or */
    import has from 'has'; // https://www.npmjs.com/package/has
    // ...
    console.log(has.call(object, key));
    ```

  <a name="objects--rest-spread"></a>
  - [3.8](#objects--rest-spread) Prefer the object spread operator over [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest operator to get a new object with certain properties omitted.

    ```javascript
    // very bad
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = Object.assign(original, { c: 3 }); // this mutates `original` ಠ_ಠ
    delete copy.a; // so does this

    // bad
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = Object.assign({}, original, { c: 3 }); // copy => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

    // good
    const original = { a: 1, b: 2 };
    const copy = { ...original, c: 3 }; // copy => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

    const { a, ...noA } = copy; // noA => { b: 2, c: 3 }
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Arrays

  <a name="arrays--literals"></a><a name="4.1"></a>
  - [4.1](#arrays--literals) Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: [`no-array-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-array-constructor.html)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const items = new Array();

    // good
    const items = [];
    ```

  <a name="arrays--push"></a><a name="4.2"></a>
  - [4.2](#arrays--push) Use [Array#push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.

    ```javascript
    const someStack = [];

    // bad
    someStack[someStack.length] = 'abracadabra';

    // good
    someStack.push('abracadabra');
    ```

  <a name="es6-array-spreads"></a><a name="4.3"></a>
  - [4.3](#es6-array-spreads) Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const len = items.length;
    const itemsCopy = [];
    let i;

    for (i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
      itemsCopy[i] = items[i];
    }

    // good
    const itemsCopy = [...items];
    ```

  <a name="arrays--from"></a>
  <a name="arrays--from-iterable"></a><a name="4.4"></a>
  - [4.4](#arrays--from-iterable) To convert an iterable object to an array, use spreads `...` instead of [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).

    ```javascript
    const foo = document.querySelectorAll('.foo');

    // good
    const nodes = Array.from(foo);

    // best
    const nodes = [...foo];
    ```

  <a name="arrays--from-array-like"></a>
  - [4.5](#arrays--from-array-like) Use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) for converting an array-like object to an array.

    ```javascript
    const arrLike = { 0: 'foo', 1: 'bar', 2: 'baz', length: 3 };

    // bad
    const arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrLike);

    // good
    const arr = Array.from(arrLike);
    ```

  <a name="arrays--mapping"></a>
  - [4.6](#arrays--mapping) Use [`Array.from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from) instead of spread `...` for mapping over iterables, because it avoids creating an intermediate array.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const baz = [...foo].map(bar);

    // good
    const baz = Array.from(foo, bar);
    ```

  <a name="arrays--callback-return"></a><a name="4.5"></a>
  - [4.7](#arrays--callback-return) Use return statements in array method callbacks. It’s ok to omit the return if the function body consists of a single statement returning an expression without side effects, following [8.2](#arrows--implicit-return). eslint: [`array-callback-return`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/array-callback-return)

    ```javascript
    // good
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
      const y = x + 1;
      return x * y;
    });

    // good
    [1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1);

    // bad - no returned value means `acc` becomes undefined after the first iteration
    [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) => {
      const flatten = acc.concat(item);
    });

    // good
    [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((acc, item, index) => {
      const flatten = acc.concat(item);
      return flatten;
    });

    // bad
    inbox.filter((msg) => {
      const { subject, author } = msg;
      if (subject === 'Mockingbird') {
        return author === 'Harper Lee';
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    });

    // good
    inbox.filter((msg) => {
      const { subject, author } = msg;
      if (subject === 'Mockingbird') {
        return author === 'Harper Lee';
      }

      return false;
    });
    ```

  <a name="arrays--bracket-newline"></a>
  - [4.8](#arrays--bracket-newline) Use line breaks after open and before close array brackets if an array has multiple lines

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const arr = [
      [0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5],
    ];

    const objectInArray = [{
      id: 1,
    }, {
      id: 2,
    }];

    const numberInArray = [
      1, 2,
    ];

    // good
    const arr = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]];

    const objectInArray = [
      {
        id: 1,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
      },
    ];

    const numberInArray = [
      1,
      2,
    ];
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Destructuring

  <a name="destructuring--object"></a><a name="5.1"></a>
  - [5.1](#destructuring--object) Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)

    > Why? Destructuring saves you from creating temporary references for those properties.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function getFullName(user) {
      const firstName = user.firstName;
      const lastName = user.lastName;

      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }

    // good
    function getFullName(user) {
      const { firstName, lastName } = user;
      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }

    // best
    function getFullName({ firstName, lastName }) {
      return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }
    ```

  <a name="destructuring--array"></a><a name="5.2"></a>
  - [5.2](#destructuring--array) Use array destructuring. eslint: [`prefer-destructuring`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

    // bad
    const first = arr[0];
    const second = arr[1];

    // good
    const [first, second] = arr;
    ```

  <a name="destructuring--object-over-array"></a><a name="5.3"></a>
  - [5.3](#destructuring--object-over-array) Use object destructuring for multiple return values, not array destructuring.

    > Why? You can add new properties over time or change the order of things without breaking call sites.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function processInput(input) {
      // then a miracle occurs
      return [left, right, top, bottom];
    }

    // the caller needs to think about the order of return data
    const [left, __, top] = processInput(input);

    // good
    function processInput(input) {
      // then a miracle occurs
      return { left, right, top, bottom };
    }

    // the caller selects only the data they need
    const { left, top } = processInput(input);
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Strings

  <a name="strings--quotes"></a><a name="6.1"></a>
  - [6.1](#strings--quotes) Use single quotes `''` for strings. eslint: [`quotes`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes.html)

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const name = "Capt. Janeway";

    // bad - template literals should contain interpolation or newlines
    const name = `Capt. Janeway`;

    // good
    const name = 'Capt. Janeway';
    ```

  <a name="strings--line-length"></a><a name="6.2"></a>
  - [6.2](#strings--line-length) Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should not be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

    > Why? Broken strings are painful to work with and make code less searchable.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because \
    of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do \
    with this, you would get nowhere \
    fast.';

    // bad
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because ' +
      'of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do ' +
      'with this, you would get nowhere fast.';

    // good
    const errorMessage = 'This is a super long error that was thrown because of Batman. When you stop to think about how Batman had anything to do with this, you would get nowhere fast.';
    ```

  <a name="es6-template-literals"></a><a name="6.4"></a>
  - [6.3](#es6-template-literals) When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. eslint: [`prefer-template`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template.html) [`template-curly-spacing`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing)

    > Why? Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return 'How are you, ' + name + '?';
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return ['How are you, ', name, '?'].join();
    }

    // bad
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${ name }?`;
    }

    // good
    function sayHi(name) {
      return `How are you, ${name}?`;
    }
    ```

  <a name="strings--eval"></a><a name="6.5"></a>
  - [6.4](#strings--eval) Never use `eval()` on a string, it opens too many vulnerabilities. eslint: [`no-eval`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-eval)

  <a name="strings--escaping"></a>
  - [6.5](#strings--escaping) Do not unnecessarily escape characters in strings. eslint: [`no-useless-escape`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-escape)

    > Why? Backslashes harm readability, thus they should only be present when necessary.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    const foo = '\'this\' \i\s \"quoted\"';

    // good
    const foo = '\'this\' is "quoted"';
    const foo = `my name is '${name}'`;
    ```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## Functions

  <a name="functions--declarations"></a><a name="7.1"></a>
  - [7.1](#functions--declarations) Use named function expressions instead of function declarations. eslint: [`func-style`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/func-style)

    > Why? Function declarations are hoisted, which means that it’s easy - too easy - to reference the function before it is defined in the file. This harms readability and maintainability. If you find that a function’s definition is large or complex enough that it is interfering with understanding the rest of the file, then perhaps it’s time to extract it to its own module! Don’t forget to explicitly name the expression, regardless of whether or not the name is inferred from the containing variable (which is often the case in modern browsers or when using compilers such as Babel). This eliminates any assumptions made about the Error’s call stack. ([Discussion](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/issues/794))

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function foo() {
      // ...
    }

    // bad
    const foo = function () {
      // ...
    };

    // good
    // lexical name distinguished from the variable-referenced invocation(s)
    const short = function longUniqueMoreDescriptiveLexicalFoo() {
      // ...
    };
    ```

  <a name="functions--iife"></a><a name="7.2"></a>
  - [7.2](#functions--iife) Wrap immediately invoked function expressions in parentheses. eslint: [`wrap-iife`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/wrap-iife.html)

    > Why? An immediately invoked function expression is a single unit - wrapping both it, and its invocation parens, in parens, cleanly expresses this. Note that in a world with modules everywhere, you almost never need an IIFE.

    ```javascript
    // immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE)
    (function () {
      console.log('Welcome to the Internet. Please follow me.');
    }());
    ```

  <a name="functions--in-blocks"></a><a name="7.3"></a>
  - [7.3](#functions--in-blocks) Never declare a function in a non-function block (`if`, `while`, etc). Assign the function to a variable instead. Browsers will allow you to do it, but they all interpret it differently, which is bad news bears. eslint: [`no-loop-func`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-loop-func.html)

  <a name="functions--note-on-blocks"></a><a name="7.4"></a>
  - [7.4](#functions--note-on-blocks) **Note:** ECMA-262 defines a `block` as a list of statements. A function declaration is not a statement.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    if (currentUser) {
      function test() {
        console.log('Nope.');
      }
    }

    // good
    let test;
    if (currentUser) {
      test = () => {
        console.log('Yup.');
      };
    }
    ```

  <a name="functions--arguments-shadow"></a><a name="7.5"></a>
  - [7.5](#functions--arguments-shadow) Never name a parameter `arguments`. This will take precedence over the `arguments` object that is given to every function scope.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function foo(name, options, arguments) {
      // ...
    }

    // good
    function foo(name, options, args) {
      // ...
    }
    ```

  <a name="es6-rest"></a><a name="7.6"></a>
  - [7.6](#es6-rest) Never use `arguments`, opt to use rest syntax `...` instead. eslint: [`prefer-rest-params`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-rest-params)

    > Why? `...` is explicit about which arguments you want pulled. Plus, rest arguments are a real Array, and not merely Array-like like `arguments`.

    ```javascript
    // bad
    function concatenateAll() {
      const args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
      return args.join('');
    }

    // good
    function concatenateAll(...args) {
      return args.join('');
    }
    ```

  <a name="es6-default-parameters"></a><a name="7.7"></a>
  - [7.7](#es6-default-parameters) Use default parameter syntax rather than mutating function arguments.

    ```javascript
    // really bad
    function handleThings(opts) {
      // No! We shouldn’t mutate function arguments.
      // Double bad: if opts is falsy it'll be set to an object which may
      // be what you want but it can introduce subtle bugs.
      opts = opts || {};
      // ...
    }

    // still bad
    function handleThings(opts) {
      if (opts === void 0) {
        opts = {};
      }
      // ...
    }

    // good
    function handleThings(opts = {}) {

## Clean Code Principles

Read the following article that lists the 15 basic steps to guaranteeing your code is clean and easy to read. The language being shown in the list is PHP, but the concepts discussed can be applied to all programming languages.

- Commenting & Documentation
- Consistent Indentation
- Avoid Obvious Comments
- Code Grouping: More often than not, certain tasks require a few lines of code. It is a good idea to keep these tasks within separate blocks of code, with some spaces between them.
- Consistent Naming Scheme: First of all, the names should have word boundaries. There are two popular options:

camelCase: First letter of each word is capitalized, except the first word.
underscores: Underscores between words, like: mysql_real_escape_string().

- DRY Principle
DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. Also known as DIE: Duplication is Evil.

The principle states:

"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

The purpose for most applications (or computers in general) is to automate repetitive tasks. This principle should be maintained in all code, even web applications. The same piece of code should not be repeated over and over again.

- Avoid Deep Nesting
Too many levels of nesting can make code harder to read and follow.
- Limit Line Length
- File and Folder Organization
Technically, you could write an entire application code within a single file. But that would prove to be a nightmare to read and maintain.
- One of the best approaches is to either use a framework, or imitate their folder structure.
- Consistent Temporary Names
Normally, the variables should be descriptive and contain one or more words. But, this doesn't necessarily apply to temporary variables. They can be as short as a single character.
- Read Open Source Code
Open Source projects are built with the input of many developers. These projects need to maintain a high level of code readability so that the team can work together as efficiently as possible. Therefore, it is a good idea to browse through the source code of these projects to observe what these developers are doing.
- 16 - Code Refactoring
When you "refactor," you make changes to the code without changing any of its functionality. You can think of it like a "clean up," for the sake of improving readability and quality.

This doesn't include bug fixes or the addition of any new functionality. You might refactor code that you have written the day before, while it's still fresh in your head, so that it is more readable and reusable when you may potentially look at it two months from now. As the motto says: "refactor early, refactor often."

You may apply any of the "best practices" of code readability during the refactoring process.








## HTTP In Depth

### What is HyperText?
HyperText is the HT in HTTP and HTML, and its origins date back to the 1960's

Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts.

### Structure of a URL
Every web developer should be able to correctly identify a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL.

With Hypertext and HTTP, URL is one of the key concepts of the Web. It is the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web.

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc. In practice, there are some exceptions, the most common being a URL pointing to a resource that no longer exists or that has moved. As the resource represented by the URL and the URL itself are handled by the Web server, it is up to the owner of the web server to carefully manage that resource and its associated URL.

Basics: anatomy of a URLSection
Here are some examples of URLs:

- https://developer.mozilla.org
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=URL
Any of those URLs can be typed into your browser's address bar to tell it to load the associated page (resource).

A URL is composed of different parts, some mandatory and others optional. Let's see the most important parts using the following URL:

http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument

http --> is the protocol. The first part of the URL indicates which protocol the browser must use. A protocol is a set method for exchanging or transferring data around a computer network. Usually for websites it is the HTTP protocol or its secured version, HTTPS. The Web requires one of these two, but browsers also know how to handle other protocols such as mailto: (to open a mail client) or ftp: to handle file transfer, so don't be surprised if you see such protocols.

www.example.com --> is the domain name. It indicates which Web server is being requested. Alternatively, it is possible to directly use an IP address, but because it is less convenient, it is not often used on the Web.

:80 --> is the port. It indicates the technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server. It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to grant access to its resources. Otherwise it is mandatory.

/path/to/myfile.html --> is the path to the resource on the Web server. In the early days of the Web, a path like this represented a physical file location on the Web server. Nowadays, it is mostly an abstraction handled by Web servers without any physical reality.

?key1=value1&key2=value2 --> are extra parameters provided to the Web server. Those parameters are a list of key/value pairs separated with the & symbol. The Web server can use those parameters to do extra stuff before returning the resource. Each Web server has its own rules regarding parameters, and the only reliable way to know if a specific Web server is handling parameters is by asking the Web server owner.

`#`SomewhereInTheDocument --> is an anchor to another part of the resource itself. An anchor represents a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource, giving the browser the directions to show the content located at that "bookmarked" spot. On an HTML document, for example, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined; on a video or audio document, the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents. It is worth noting that the part after the #, also known as the fragment identifier, is never sent to the server with the request.

You might think of a URL like a regular postal mail address: the protocol represents the postal service you want to use, the domain name is the city or town, and the port is like the zip code; the path represents the building where your mail should be delivered; the parameters represent extra information such as the number of the apartment in the building; and, finally, the anchor represents the actual person to whom you've addressed your mail.

### Headers

Every HTTP request and response consists of a header and a body. The content of the request (or response) is in body, and additional information (metadata, addressing info, cookies, content type) is sent in the header.

For example, the HTML code that describes a webpage is sent in the body of a response. When you submit a form (login, password, image upload), then the form data is sent to the server in the body of the request.

This section introduces some of these concepts in more depth, focusing on important fields. Future activities will continue to build on these principles.

### Header Fields & Response Status Codes

http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/http-tut.html

### User-Agent Header

In HTTP, the User-Agent string is often used for content negotiation, where the origin server selects suitable content or operating parameters for the response. For example, the User-Agent string might be used by a web server to choose variants based on the known capabilities of a particular version of client software. The concept of content tailoring is built into the HTTP standard in RFC 1945 "for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations.”

What is a "User Agent"? A User Agent is a short string that web browsers and other applications send to identify themselves to web servers.  — Definitions.net

Here's yours: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36

### Stateless Protocol

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.

### JSON

JSON is a data format that underpins many modern web services. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it's actually a subset of the JavaScript language.

This module will introduce the fundamentals of JSON and illustrate its importance in web technology.

According to json.org:

JSON is built on two structures:

A collection of name/value pairs. (In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.)
An ordered list of values. (In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.)
These are universal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures.

An Object encoded using JSON looks like this:

```JAVASCRIPT

{
  "name": "New York City",
  "boroughs": [
    "Manhattan",
    "Queens",
    "Brooklyn",
    "The Bronx",
    "Staten Island"],
  "population": 8491079,
  "area_codes": [212, 347, 646, 718, 917, 929],
  "position": { "lat": 40.7127, "lng": -74.0059 }
}
Note that the keys are always "strings", and the values can be numbers, strings, or objects themselves.

```

### Command Line cURL

This module will introduce one of the cornerstone tools that should be in every developer's arsenal, cURL.

cURL is a command line utility that is used to make HTTP requests to a given URL and it outputs the response. It allows you to see the URL.

For example, www.example.com

Download a Single File
The following command will get the content of the URL and display it in the STDOUT (i.e on your terminal).

$ curl http://www.centos.org

use that command in you terminal

## File IO in NodeJS

### Require Module: fs

The File System fs module in NodeJS exposes the standard POSIX functions.

Let's start with a synchronous file write,

```javascript

var fs = require("fs");

var filePath = "/tmp/test_sync.txt";
var fileData = "Testing synchronous file write.\n";

fs.writeFileSync(filePath, fileData);
console.log("successfully wrote to", filePath);

```

We can confirm that the file was successfully written using cat /tmp/test_sync.txt - you should see,

  cat /tmp/test_sync.txt
  Testing synchronous file write.

### Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming is when a unit of work is run separately from the main thread of the program and notifies the program of its completion.

Imagine you and a friend are preparing for a party. You (the main program thread) tell your friend (the asynchronous function) that you need them to get cups for the party. While they are getting cups, you are making the rest of the preparations based on your immaculate party prep schedule.

You don't need your friend to complete their task of retrieving cups in order to continue with your work. You send them on their way, and await their call to tell you if they were successful.

This differs from synchronous programming. In the same situation, synchronous code would have you wait until your friend returned with the cups before letting you continue your work. You would be sitting around waiting ("idling" or "blocked") despite having plenty of other tasks to complete. Now you're stuck waiting for Jim, a friend of a friend who seems like a bit of a flake. He hasn't even paid you back for lunch from two weeks ago. Who knows if he'll even come back with the cups? You definitely don't want to wait on Jim!

In the world of computing, operations such as I/O (input/output) are time consuming and therefore analogous to our party problem.

### Asynchronous Callbacks

Now let's perform the same file writing task we performed earlier, but this time in an asynchronous manner.

Notice that the writeFile method takes a third parameter – a callback function, which is executed after the file-writing is complete. By convention in Node.js, the first parameter is an error variable, which would be null if there were no errors.

```javascript

var fs = require("fs");

var filePath = "/tmp/test_async.txt";
var fileData = "Testing asynchronous file write.\n";

fs.writeFile(filePath, fileData, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  console.log("Successfully wrote to", filePath);
});

```

Note: Callback functions in Node pass err as the first argument (by convention). That means if there was a problem writing the file as requested, then the err argument will specify the exception details, otherwise it will be null.

Similarly, to confirm this from the command line,

  cat /tmp/test_async.txt
  Testing asynchronous file write.

### Open a File

Syntax
Following is the syntax of the method to open a file in asynchronous mode −

```javascript

fs.open(path, flags[, mode], callback)

```

Parameters
Here is the description of the parameters used −

path − This is the string having file name including path.

flags − Flags indicate the behavior of the file to be opened. All possible values have been mentioned below.

mode − It sets the file mode (permission and sticky bits), but only if the file was created. It defaults to 0666, readable and writeable.

callback − This is the callback function which gets two arguments (err, fd).

more on --> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_file_system.htm

### Get File Information

Syntax
Following is the syntax of the method to get the information about a file −

  fs.stat(path, callback)

Parameters
Here is the description of the parameters used −

path − This is the string having file name including path.

callback − This is the callback function which gets two arguments (err, stats) where stats is an object of fs.Stats type which is printed below in the example.

### Writing a File

Syntax
Following is the syntax of one of the methods to write into a file −

fs.writeFile(filename, data[, options], callback)
This method will over-write the file if the file already exists. If you want to write into an existing file then you should use another method available.

Parameters
Here is the description of the parameters used −

path − This is the string having the file name including path.

data − This is the String or Buffer to be written into the file.

options − The third parameter is an object which will hold {encoding, mode, flag}. By default. encoding is utf8, mode is octal value 0666. and flag is 'w'

callback − This is the callback function which gets a single parameter err that returns an error in case of any writing error.

### Reading a File

Syntax
Following is the syntax of one of the methods to read from a file −

fs.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)
This method will use file descriptor to read the file. If you want to read the file directly using the file name, then you should use another method available.

Parameters
Here is the description of the parameters used −

fd − This is the file descriptor returned by fs.open().

buffer − This is the buffer that the data will be written to.

offset − This is the offset in the buffer to start writing at.

length − This is an integer specifying the number of bytes to read.

position − This is an integer specifying where to begin reading from in the file. If position is null, data will be read from the current file position.

callback − This is the callback function which gets the three arguments, (err, bytesRead, buffer).

## Character encodings for beginners

As a content author or developer, you should nowadays always choose the UTF-8 character encoding for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single character encoding to handle any character you are likely to need. This greatly simplifies things. Using Unicode throughout your system also removes the need to track and convert between various character encodings.

Content authors need to find out how to declare the character encoding used for the document format they are working with.

Note that just declaring a different encoding in your page won't change the bytes; you need to save the text in that encoding too.

As a content author, you need to check what encoding your editor or scripts are saving text in, and how to save text in UTF-8. (It's usually the default these days.) You may also need to check that your server is serving documents with the right HTTP declarations.

## Streams in NodeJS

What are Streams?
Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. In Node.js, there are four types of streams −

- Readable − Stream which is used for read operation.
- Writable − Stream which is used for write operation.

Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times. For example, some of the commonly used events are −

- data − This event is fired when there is data is available to read.
- end − This event is fired when there is no more data to read.
- error − This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data.
- finish − This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.

This tutorial provides a basic understanding of the commonly used operations on Streams.
