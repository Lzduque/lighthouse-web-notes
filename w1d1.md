# GitHub Basics!
- create the directory
mkdir lighthouse-web-notes
- go into the directory
cd lighthouse-web-notes
- initialize the directory
git init
- create a file in the directory
touch README.md
- add the file in the repository
git add README.md
- commit to the changes
git commit -m  "Blank README.md added"
- add the changes file to your new repo - create it in the GitHub website then copy and paste the url of the new repo here - Add the URL of the new repo as a remote on your local repo
git remote add origin <URL>
- push the changes to the repo
git push -u origin master

forking a gist -->
you fork it in GitHub
clone via SSH
then you go to terminal
do into the right folder
- git clone git@gist.github.com:YOUR_FORKS_ID.git lunch
when youre done:
- git add lunch.js
- git commit -m "Some important context here"
- git push

# Workflow as a Dev
- GitHub - start a new project
That will create a repository!
YES initialize with a README file! - that will help you to find the project/repository
- Edit the README.md explaining what the project is about - and plan what youre goingo to do!
- Clone the repository - copy the ssh code
ONLY CLONE WHEN YOURE INSIDE THE LIGHTHOUSE LABS FOLDER!
- Git clone url ssh
- Go into the folder of the project
- Open the files and WORK!
- see the status of the project --> GIT STATUS .
You will be able to see if the changes were saved
- git add README.md
- git commit -m "XXX"
- Use console.log to test what youre coding!
- Don't forget to git add the new files and commit!
By now, the add and commits are not connected to the remote server!
- git status, add, commit is the small work flow
- git push --> that will send it all to the server (when you do the clone from the server, you dont need to push origin/master, becasuse it already knows where it should go)
